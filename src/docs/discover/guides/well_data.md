# Well data

With Discover, you can **explore**, **analyze**, and **visualize** a wide range of **well data sets**. Then share data or snapshots with your fellow workers using the [Favorites](./favorites.md) functionality.

## Search and analyze well data today

Search and find well data using the **Search** field, the **Polygon** tool, or select a filter in the **Wells** list in the left pane. You can filter by the data source, field/block/operator, well characteristics, measurements, NDS, and NPT. Then open the **Wells** tab and select the wells you want to analyze further.

Select **View** to view helpful metadata for the selected wells, such as field, source, operator, and others, and to view separate tabs with more insights. See below for more information about each tab.

### Trajectories

Use this view to see graphs with well paths. You can zoom, take snapshots, download the trajectories, and select wells or wellbores to compare data.

### NDS (No Drilling Surprise) events

This table shows risk types, severity, probability, subtypes, hole diameter, start and end, and TVD offset of NDS events. You can filter on properties like risk type, severity, and probability.

### NPT (Non-Productive Time) events

This table and graph shows the start and end date, NPT MD, NPT codes, duration, descriptions, root cause, and failure location. You can filter by NPT duration (hrs), values, and codes.

### Casings

Use this tab to visualize casing schematics and NPTs associated with a wellbore in MD. You can hover over an NPT cluster to visualize the breakdown of NPT events per NPT code.

### Well logs

This tab allows you to visualize log data in a tabular view with source, category, and name. Select one or more wellbores to see the log data of the selected wellbores.

### Related documents

This table shows documents related to the selected wellbores. You can toggle on or off wellbores from the left panel. Also, you can search by file name or keyword and filter on file type, document type, date range, and source.

### Geomechanics & PPFG

The Geomechanics & PPFG tab allows you to visualize PPFG and geomechanics data of selected wellbores in well centric or curve centric views. You can filter curves based on the curve name, visualize the curves in MD/TVD, or the preferred choice of units.
