# Explore and navigate

**Discover and explore** all the subsurface data, such as **documents and well data** from the Discover landing page. You can search by any name or number or use the **Polygon** tool to find documents within a geographical area. Then apply **filters** for **Documents**, **Seismic data**, and **Well data**, or **sort** the results by clicking the table headers in the result list.

## Search using keywords

Enter **any text or numbers** such as document names or well names in the **Search** field and click **Enter** to bring up all types of documents, well data, and seismic data. The tabs on top of the page show the results for each category.

Add your search to **Saved searches** on the **Favorites** page by clicking the **Saved search** icon in the **Search** field and add your favorite items for easy access to a **set of Favorites**. You can read more about this [here](./favorites.md).
