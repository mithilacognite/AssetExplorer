# Download and install the Remote application

We recommend running the Remote application on a **PC** if you use Remote **daily**. Your PC needs a modern dedicated graphics card, such as a 20 or 30 series graphics card from NVIDIA. Follow the steps below to **download** and **install** Remote.

1.  Contact your Cognite representative to get a download link for the Remote desktop application. Follow the link to download and store the zip file containing the Remote application and the required libraries on your PC.

2.  **Unpack** the zip file to a folder, for example `C:\cognite_remote\`.
3.  The Remote application is based on the Unreal Engine. If you haven't installed the **Unreal Engine libraries** on your PC before:
    1.  Open Windows Explorer and navigate to the folder where you unpacked the Remote zip file.
    2.  Navigate to the `Engine\Extras\Redist\en-us\` subfolder and run the Unreal Engine installer: `UE4PrereqSetup_x64.exe`.
4.  To **start the Remote application**, navigate back to the folder where you unpacked the Remote zip file and run `CogniteRemote.exe`.

    If Windows warns you that this is an unrecognized app, select **More info** and then **Run anyway**.
