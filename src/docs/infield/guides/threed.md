# 3D

Use the 3D view in InField to see where on a plant a piece of equipment is placed, and to investigate the immediate surroundings.

When you view the 3D model on a mobile device, only a small area around the equipment is loaded into view. When you view the 3D model on a PC or Mac, the full model is loaded. Loading the full model takes about 50-60 seconds (depending on the plant size), but lets you explore the entire plant in 3D.

On mobile, you can [see checklist elements](checklists.md#see-checklist-items-in-3d) in your immediate surroundings.
