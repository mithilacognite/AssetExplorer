# Checklists from work orders

Checklists can be based on objects imported from your work management application, such as SAP or WorkMate. This gives efficient access to information about all of the inserted tags in the field.

## Open objects as checklists

Navigate to an open [work order](../work_orders.md) either from the Revisions pane or on a tag and click **Objects** on the left side heading. You will see the number of objects retrieved from the source work management system. Click **Open as checklist** to create a checklist that is automatically named with the work order code. Note that the **operation ID** is displayed for each checklist element.

If a colleague has already created a checklist, you can even join this list.

## Use checklists to document work in a work management system

To document that the work is completed, you can download a PDF version of the checklist. In addition to checklist comments, the PDF contains information about who set each checklist to the final state and at what time. You can upload the PDF document as an attachment to the work order in SAP, Workmate, IFS, or similar tools.
