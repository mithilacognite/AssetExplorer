# Trends

The trends section automatically shows the most relevant time series on a tag. In the side panel, you can select other time series on the tag. You can also use the **Compare trends** function in the top right corner to compare with timeseries from other tags.

## View trends

You select which time series to show as trends by adding time series from the **Other time series on this tag** section to the **Recently selected time series** section. The default time window when you open the trend page is 1 day, but you can adjust this with the time interval selection.

The default y-axis setting is computed based on last years values, disregarding any out-of-bounds values (typically when sensors fail). You can show and hide the Y-axis with the **Toggle Y-axis** button.

:::info note
There can be a short time delay when you view trend data. You can see the time difference between "now"Â and the sensor timestamp of the last data point in the brackets in the legend.
