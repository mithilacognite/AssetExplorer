# Images

With InField you can share images from the field with users in the office or at remote locations. For example, you can quickly verify if a particular situation is normal or not, or you can document the state before and after you have performed a maintenance task.

Anyone can upload, comment on and delete images. You can download an image by right-clicking (desktop) or long-pressing (mobile device) the image. On the desktop, you can also upload images from the drive.
