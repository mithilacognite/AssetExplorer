# Alarms

**View a list of all active and cleared** alarms on an asset on the InField home page. The list updates every 10 seconds to make sure you always have the latest overview. You can also add useful information in the **Comments** field.

If an alarm is linked to a sensor, you can navigate to [Trends ](./trends.md) to check the time series for the sensor.
