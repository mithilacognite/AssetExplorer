# Relationships

<!--What are Relationships?  Generic overview information-->

The **Relationships** resource type represents connections between resource objects in Cognite Data Fusion (CDF). Each relationship is between a source and a target object and is defined by a **relationship type** and the **external IDs** and **resource types** of the source and target objects. Optionally, a relationship can be time-constrained with a start and end time.

The `externalId` field uniquely identifies each relationship.

To define and manage the available relationship types, use the [labels](labels.md) resource type. For example, you can define labels like these and use them as relationship types:

- `flowsTo` - to describe the flow between assets.
- `belongsTo` - to describe that a file resource belongs to a particular asset resource.
- `isParentOf` - to build a hierarchy of assets.
- `implements` - to describe that a physical item implements a functional asset at a specific point in time.

NOTE: These labels are informational only, and they are case-sensitive. I.e., `flowsTo` and `FlowsTo` are not the same.

## About relationships

<!--What can I do with relationships?  -->

Typically, asset resources originate from a maintenance system, and the hierarchical structure from the maintenance system often defines how the asset resources are organized in Cognite Data Fusion (CDF).

The **relationships** resource type allows you to organize the assets in other structures **in addition to** the standard hierarchical asset structure.

For example, you can choose to organize the assets by their physical **location**, where the grouping nodes in the hierarchy are buildings and floors, rather than systems and functions. Another example is to build a graph structure that allows you to navigate assets by mimicking their physical **connections** through wires or pipes. See the [Modeling asset structures with relationships](../../../cdf/concepts/model_asset_structures.md) for examples.

Before you create a relationship, make sure that the relationship type exists as a [label](labels.md). When you create a relationship, you must specify its type using the `externalId` of the relevant label.

When you create relationship, it is good practice to add them to a data set for grouping and governance.

It is not a requirement that the source or target resource exist when you create a relationship. This allow you to create relationships between objects that does not yet exist in CDF.

## Create a relationship between two assets

To create a relationship, you need to give it an ID and a type and specify the source and target resource objects the relationship connects. The relationship ID must be an [`externalId`](../external_id.md). The relationship type must be the `externalId` of a [label](./labels.md).

Relationships should be created within a data set for logical grouping and governance.

This example request creates a relationship:

```http
POST /api/v1/projects/publicdata/relationships
Host: api.cognitedata.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "items": [
    {
      "externalId": "relationship_1",
      "dataSetId": 5514071318856557,
      "sourceExternalId": "asset_1",
      "sourceType": "asset",
      "targetExternalId": "asset_2",
      "targetType": "asset",
      "labels": [
        {
          "externalId": "flowsTo"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Create a relationship between a file and an asset

You can use relationships to create links between any resources by specifying the `sourceType` and `targetType`.

This example shows how to create a relationship of type `belongsTo` between a file and an asset resource.

```http
POST /api/v1/projects/publicdata/relationships
Host: api.cognitedata.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "items": [
    {
      "externalId": "relationship_2",
      "dataSetId": 5514071318856557,
      "sourceExternalId": "file_1",
      "sourceType": "file",
      "targetExternalId": "asset_1",
      "targetType": "asset",
      "labels": [
        {
          "externalId": "belongsTo"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## Create a time-ranged relationship between two assets

When you have physical equipment as part of the asset resources, you can use relationships to capture how a physical equipment serves at different functional locations over time. You can specify the timespan a relationships is valid for by specifying the `startTime` and `endTime` properties.

This example shows how to create a relationship between two assets with a time-range.

```http
POST /api/v1/projects/publicdata/relationships
Host: api.cognitedata.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "items": [
    {
      "externalId": "relationship_3",
      "dataSetId": 5514071318856557,
      "sourceExternalId": "asset_1",
      "sourceType": "asset",
      "targetExternalId": "asset_2",
      "targetType": "asset",
      "startTime": 1514768406,
      "endTime": 1577840406,
      "labels": [
        {
          "externalId": "flowsTo"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

## List relationships

To list existing relationships, use:

```http
POST /api/v1/projects/publicdata/relationships/list
Host: api.cognitedata.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{}
```

## List relationships for a particular asset

Relationships are directional. Therefore, we split this into two calls (one where the asset is the source, and one where the asset is the target).

```http
POST /api/v1/projects/publicdata/relationships/list
Host: api.cognitedata.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "filter": {
    "sourceTypes": ["asset"],
    "sourceExternalIds": ["asset_1"]
  }
}
```

```http
POST /api/v1/projects/publicdata/relationships/list
Host: api.cognitedata.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "filter": {
    "targetTypes": ["asset"],
    "targetExternalIds": ["asset_1"]
  }
}
```

## List relationships of a particular type for a particular asset

To retrieve all `flowsTo` relationships of `asset_1`.

```http
POST /api/v1/projects/publicdata/relationships/list
Host: api.cognitedata.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "filter": {
    "sourceTypes": ["asset"],
    "sourceExternalIds": ["asset_1"],
    "labels": {"containsAll": [{"externalId": "flowsTo"}]}
  }
}
```

## List relationship for an asset at a specific point in time

To list all time-ranged relationships of an asset, with type `implements`, and valid at a specific point in time, use:

```http
POST /api/v1/projects/publicdata/relationships/list
Host: api.cognitedata.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "filter": {
    "sourceTypes": ["asset"],
    "sourceExternalIds": ["asset_1"],
    "activeAtTime": {
      "min": 1601284751,
      "max": 1601284751
    },
    "labels": {"containsAll": [{"externalId": "implements"}]}
  }
}
```

<!-- ## Update a relationship -->

## Delete a relationship

To delete a relationship, use:

```http
POST /api/v1/projects/publicdata/relationships/delete
Host: api.cognitedata.com
Authorization: Bearer <token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "items": [{"externalId": "relationship_1"}]
}
```
