# Postman

We recommend downloading, installing and using **[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)** to test API requests and verify responses.

## Set up Postman using OpenID Connect

### Prerequisites

To use the **Implicit** grant type with your requests in Postman, you need to grant access to a multi-tenant app in Azure AD to use CDF with Postman. To grant access, you need to be an Azure AD tenant administrator.

Follow the steps in [How to register Cognite API](../../../cdf/access/guides/configure_cdf_azure_oidc#step-11-permit-the-cognite-api-to-access-user-profiles-in-azure-ad) to register the app.

When you have registered the app, you will be able to sign in with your Azure AD credentials.

### Step 1: Import your Postman collection

1. In Postman, select **Import** > **Link** and enter the URL to import your latest API V1 Postman collection:
`https://storage.googleapis.com/cognite-postman-collections/v1.json`

   <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/import-collection-link.png" alt="Import collection"/>

1. Select **Continue** > **Import** to import the collection.

### Step 2: Set up environment variables

1. To create a new environment, navigate to **Environments** on the left sidebar. Click **+ Create new Environment** and give it a name.

   <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/create-environment.png" alt="Create environment" width="350px"/>

2. Add the variables:

   - **tenant-id**: This is your Directory (tenant) ID. To find the tenant ID, go to your Azure Active Directory. You can find your Tenant ID on the Overview page.

     <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/aad-tenant-id.png" alt="Tenant ID" width="500px"/>

    :::info NOTE
    We recommended that you work with the current value of a variable to prevent sharing sensitive and confidential information with your team.
    :::

   - **token**: Using OAuth 2.0, we will generate a new token. It will populate automatically, so you will leave it blank as an environment variable.

   - **baseURL**: You can find your baseURL from the CDF project. Navigate to your CDF project. Under **Manage & Configure** > **Manage access**, select **Open ID connect** tab. The URL in the audience field is the baseURL.

     <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/baseurl-cdf.png" alt="Base URL" width="450px"/>

   - **project**: This is your CDF project name.

     <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/project-name-cdf.png" alt="Project name" width="350px"/>

### Step 3: Update authorization

1. To update the authorization, navigate to the **Authorization** tab in the collection overview.

2. Select **OAuth 2.0** as Type and **Request Headers** as Add auth data to.

3. Select **Configure New Token** and specify these configuration options:

   - Enter a **Token Name**.
   - Select the **Grant Type** as **Implicit**.
   - Input the **Callback URL** as `https://postman.cogniteapp.com/loggedin`.

     :::info NOTE
     If you do not select the checkbox **Authorise using browser**, you can input the Callback URL. Otherwise, the Callback URL gets auto-populated on selection. You will be redirected to the **Callback URL**, once your application is authorized.
     :::

   - Enter the **Auth URL** as `https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenant-id/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`. Replace the **tenant-id** obtained from the previous step.
   - Input the **Client ID** as `https://postman.cogniteapp.com`.
   - The **Scope** is `$baseUrl/$scope`, where **$baseUrl** is as above in 2.2, and **$scope** is `user_impersonation`, `DATA.VIEW`, `IDENTITY` etc.

    `user_impersonation` grants all permissions to the user assigned to access the API. The `DATA.VIEW` scope grants read-only access to data in CDF, for example, to view files, time series, RAW, and other CDF resources. To know more about CDF's scopes, see the different [Access token scopes](../../../cdf/access/concepts/access_token_scopes.md).

    :::tip tip
     While using a scope for the first time, the admin has to define the scope explicitly. The admin must then consent to use this scope for the authorization process.
    :::

   - Select **Client Authentication** as **Send as Basic Auth header**.

      <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/implicit-grant-oidc.png" alt="OAuth 2.0 implicit"/>

4. Select **Get New Access Token** > **Proceed** > **Use Token**.

You are now ready to use Postman with OIDC as the authentication method.

## Set up Postman using API keys

### Step 1: Import your Postman collection

In Postman, select **Import** > **Import From Link** and enter a URL to import one of our Postman collections:

| API version | API Status | Postman collection link                                                                                                   |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| API v1      | Stable     | **Recommended for production environments.** <p></p> `https://storage.googleapis.com/cognite-postman-collections/v1.json` |
| Playground  | Unstable   | `https://storage.googleapis.com/cognite-postman-collections/playground.json`                                              |

Click **Continue** > **Import**. You have successfully imported the collection.

### Step 2: Set up API keys and environment variables

Set the `api-key` and `project` environment variables. The `api-key` is injected as the header to authenticate your requests, and the `project` routes all your requests to the correct project in Cognite Data Fusion. To set the environment variables:

1.  Click **Environment quick look** (eye) icon in the top-right corner. Click **Add** and enter an **Environment Name**, for example `cognite-publicdata`.
1.  Under **VARIABLE**, enter `api-key`, and in the **CURRENT_VALUE** field enter your API key.
1.  Add another **VARIABLE**, name it `project`, and in the **CURRENT_VALUE** field enter the name of your project.

    If you got your API key from the [Open Industrial Data Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4DAAo55IS8), enter `publicdata` as the name of the project.

1.  Click **Save** to save the environment variables you have added.
1.  If necessary, select your newly created environment in the dropdown menu in the top right corner.

### Step 3: Send your API request

Make a test API request to check that your integration is working correctly:

1.  Click the **Cognite API** collection in the left-hand menu, and select **Assets** > **List assets**.

    <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/cogniteapi-collection.png" alt="List assets" width="350px"/>

1.  Click **Send**.

Cognite Data Fusion returns a list of all [asset objects](/api/v1/#tag/Assets) in response to your API request. Once you have successfully made an API request, youâ€™re ready to begin interacting with the Cognite Data Fusion API through our Software Development Kits (SDKs).

You are now ready to use Postman with API keys as authentication method.
