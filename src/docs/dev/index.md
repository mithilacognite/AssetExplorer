# Cognite developer documentation

Get familiar with our open [API](../api/v1/) and [SDKs](./quickstart/#step-3-install-a-software-development-kit-sdk) and explore their features to learn how you can use **Cognite Data Fusion** to:

- **Retrieve data** from different data sources and make it available as **one complete data set** in the cloud.

- **Add** layers of **context** for deeper analytics and real-time insights into your data.

- **Develop** applications and machine learning models that match your operational needs.

## Try it now

Follow our [development quickstart](./quickstart/) to get up and running with Cognite Data Fusion in a few simple steps. And don't worry if you don't have your own project and data yet. You can use an API key and data from the [Open Industrial Data project](http://openindustrialdata.com) - a live industrial data stream - to **start learning**.

## Security

Cognite Data Fusion is designed to integrate seamlessly with your existing equipment and infrastructure, and to provide you with full visibility and control of your data. [**Your data is always your own**](../cdf/trust/security/).

Cognite calls this functionality
Contextualization, the real-time structuring
of sensor data in relation to process
diagrams, production information, 3Dmodels, and event data (maintenance,
incidents). Everything linked in the real world
is also linked in the platform. This equips
stronger machine learning applications for
optimization and automatization, as well as
human-facing applications, such as advanced
visualizations and apps for the digital field
worker

The Cognite Data Fusion offers the capability to
liberate a wide variety of industrial data from
separate, siloed source systems and collect it in
one place, automatically and without space
limitations. The CDF then structures sensor data
in relation to process diagrams, production
information, 3D-models, and event data
(maintenance, incidents). Cognite calls this
functionality Contextualization. Everything linked
in the real world is also linked in the platform.

The Cognite Data Fusion is designed with this
kind of openness in mind. Unlike the legacy
infrastructure and systems often used by large
industrial companies, the CDF is modern (i.e., no
more point-to-point integrations) and flexible.
Built on a cloud infrastructure, the CDF allows a
client to open selected data to specific,
authorized users with a simple log-in. It's also
fast, streaming the desired data with low latency,
without sacrificing security. Data is encrypted
both at rest and in transit.

Thankfully, technology has advanced to empower
this evolution of thinking about data ownership.
The Cognite Data Fusion offers a simple,
straightforward, secure way to collect and store
data as a comprehensive set in the cloud.
Cognite's customers can then provide selected
partners authenticated access to specific data sets
using an API key, allowing swift integration and
powerful interoperation

Our initial focus has been to aggregate and
process data from sensors and contextualize
it, structuring it in relation to process
diagrams, production information, 3Dmodels, and event data (maintenance,
incidents). Everything linked in the real world
is also linked in the platform. This enables
machine learning applications for
optimization and automatization, as well as
human-facing applications, such as advanced
visualizations and apps for the digital field
worker.

using automated
data extractors. Rather than collating all
master data and transactional capabilities
within a central system, the CDF removes
the silos between differing data sources.
This makes all data universally accessible
across your organization and dramatically
reduces the cost of integration and
maintenance. It also enables scalability and
speed of development, without the risk of
turning in to a multi-year IT development
project.
