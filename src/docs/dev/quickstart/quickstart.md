# Development Quickstart

Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) authenticates your API requests  to a **[project](/api/v1/#tag/Projects)** using OpenID Connect (OIDC). Get up and running with our API libraries and start working with CDF in a few simple steps.

We recommend downloading, installing and using **[Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/)** to test API requests and verify responses.

## Prerequisites

To use the **Implicit** grant type with your requests in Postman, you need to grant access to a multi-tenant app in Azure AD to use CDF with Postman. To grant access, you need to be an Azure AD tenant administrator.

Follow the steps in [How to register Cognite API](../../../cdf/access/guides/configure_cdf_azure_oidc#step-11-permit-the-cognite-api-to-access-user-profiles-in-azure-ad) to register the app.

When you have registered the app, you will be able to sign in with your Azure AD credentials.

## Step 1: Import your Postman collection

1. In Postman, select **Import** > **Link** and enter the URL to import your latest API V1 Postman collection:
`https://storage.googleapis.com/cognite-postman-collections/v1.json`

   <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/import-collection-link.png" alt="Import collection"/>

1. Select **Continue** > **Import** to import the collection.

## Step 2: Set up environment variables

1. To create a new environment, navigate to **Environments** on the left sidebar. Click **+ Create new Environment** and give it a name.

   <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/create-environment.png" alt="Create environment" width="350px"/>

2. Add the variables:

   - **tenant-id**: This is your Directory (tenant) ID. To find the tenant ID, go to your Azure Active Directory. You can find your Tenant ID on the Overview page.

     <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/aad-tenant-id.png" alt="Tenant ID" width="500px"/>

    :::info NOTE
    We recommended that you work with the current value of a variable to prevent sharing sensitive and confidential information with your team.
    :::

   - **token**: Using OAuth 2.0, we will generate a new token. It will populate automatically, so you will leave it blank as an environment variable.

   - **baseURL**: You can find your baseURL from the CDF project. Navigate to your CDF project. Under **Manage & Configure** > **Manage access**, select **Open ID connect** tab. The URL in the audience field is the baseURL.

     <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/baseurl-cdf.png" alt="Base URL" width="450px"/>

   - **project**: This is your CDF project name.

     <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/project-name-cdf.png" alt="Project name" width="350px"/>

3. Click **Save** to save the environment variables you have added.

4. If necessary, select your newly created environment in the dropdown menu in the top right corner.

    <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/select-environment.png" alt="List all assets" width="300px"/>

## Step 3: Update authorization

1. To update the authorization, navigate to the **Authorization** tab in the collection overview.

2. Select **OAuth 2.0** as Type and **Request Headers** as Add auth data to.

3. Select **Configure New Token** and specify these configuration options:

   - Enter a **Token Name**.
   - Select the **Grant Type** as **Implicit**.
   - Input the **Callback URL** as `https://postman.cogniteapp.com/loggedin`.

     :::info NOTE
     If you do not select the checkbox **Authorise using browser**, you can input the Callback URL. Otherwise, the Callback URL gets auto-populated on selection. You will be redirected to the **Callback URL**, once your application is authorized.
     :::

   - Enter the **Auth URL** as `https://login.microsoftonline.com/$tenant-id/oauth2/v2.0/authorize`. Replace the **tenant-id** obtained from the previous step.
   - Input the **Client ID** as `https://postman.cogniteapp.com`.
   - The **Scope** is `$baseUrl/$scope`, where **$baseUrl** is as above in 2.2, and **$scope** is `IDENTITY`, `DATA.VIEW`, `user_impersonation` etc.

    :::tip tip
     While using a scope for the first time, the admin has to define the scope explicitly. The admin must then consent to use this scope for the authorization process.
    :::
    
    `User_impersonation` grants all permissions to the user assigned to access the API. The `DATA.VIEW` scope grants read-only access to data in CDF, for example, to view files, time series, RAW, and other CDF resources. To know more about CDF's scopes, see the different [Access token scopes](../../../cdf/access/concepts/access_token_scopes.md).

   - Select **Client Authentication** as **Send as Basic Auth header**.

      <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/implicit-grant-oidc.png" alt="OAuth 2.0 implicit"/>

4. Select **Get New Access Token** > **Proceed** > **Use Token**.

You are now ready to use Postman with OIDC as the authentication method.

## Step 4: Send your API request

1.  Make a test API request to check that your integration is working correctly:

    - Click the **Cognite API** collection in the left-hand menu, and select **Assets** > **List assets**.

       <img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/cdf/dev/quickstart/cogniteapi-collection.png" alt="List assets" width="350px"/>

    - Click **Send**.

Cognite Data Fusion returns a list of all [asset objects](/api/v1/#tag/Assets) in response to your API request. For the [Open Industrial Data Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g4DAAo55IS8) the JSON results look similar to this:

Once you have successfully made an API request, you’re ready to begin interacting with the Cognite Data Fusion API through our Software Development Kits (SDKs).

## Step 5: Install a Software Development Kit (SDK)

We provide official Software Development Kits (SDKs) for [Python](/dev/guides/sdk/python/) and [JavaScript](/dev/guides/sdk/js/) with libraries that interact with the Cognite Data Fusion API.

### The Python Software Development Kit (SDK)

The Cognite Python SDK requires Python 3.5+ and provides access to the Cognite Data Fusion API from applications written in the Python language. For detailed information, see the [Cognite Python SDK Documentation](/dev/guides/sdk/python/).

:::info
To download and install Python, visit [Python.org](https://python.org/).
:::

To install the Cognite Python library:

```sh
pip install cognite-sdk
```

### The JavaScript Software Development Kit (SDK)

The Javascript SDK provides access to the Cognite Data Fusion API from applications written in client-side or server-side JavaScript. The library supports authentication through API keys (for server-side applications) and bearer tokens (for web applications). For detailed information, see the [Cognite JavaScript documentation](/dev/guides/sdk/js/).

Install the Cognite JavaScript library:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @cognite/sdk --save
```
