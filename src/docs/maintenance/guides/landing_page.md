# Landing page

The landing page is divided in two sections: **Overview** and **Risks**.

## Overview

This section displays the assets that are available to you in the application.

Choose the asset you want to work on.

To provide an instant overview, the **most critical risks** are listed where relevant.

Assets that do not have a 3D model are marked with a red cube.

## Risks

This section displays the most critical risks for all available assets.

<img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/maintain/risks_new.png" alt="Risks " width="80%"/>

Top risks are listed according to criticality. Only the most critical risks are visualized here.

Select the risks you want to look at by checking the box next to its title. These risks will be displayed under **Selected risks**.
Under **System**, the risks are sorted according to the system the risk is connected to.  
You may also filter on what risks you want to see, and export the overview.
