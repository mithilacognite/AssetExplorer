# Workspaces

Maintain's Workspace feature allows you to create comments, add shapes such as circles and rectangles on **digital** P&IDs. You no longer need to **print** paper copies to add your comments or annotations. You can also mark, measure, and generate a list of isolation points, including valve positions, on the P&ID. You can create a new workspace or modify an existing one.

To access the workspace, click the workspace icon in the top bar. **My workspaces** is empty the first time you open it. As you create and save workspaces, they will be listed in the overview.

## Start using workspaces

1. Select **Create new**.
1. Search for the tag or file you want to add to your workspace. Select the document to add it to your workspace. You can add multiple P&IDs to the same workspace.

You can also add documents to your workspace by clicking the eye icon on a work order. And you can select a contextualized asset (yellow highlight) to open up a connected P&ID.

### List

The list tool enables you to generate a list of isolation points, including valve positions, on P&IDs.

Click a mark-up in the P&ID to create a list element. If you add a list item that is not linked to a tag, you can click the field that says **Unknown tag** and enter the tag (if it exists) or add a free text. <!-- Rewrite this text-->

The status of **List element** is set (by default) to **Examine**. Click **Examine** to change status to **Open** (green) or **Closed** (red).

Use the arrow to re-order your list elements. Notice how numbers on P&ID update. When your list is complete, you can export it to a CSV file.

If the Stamp functionality is enabled, images, or stamps, will be available to you when clicking on the stamp tool. You can then add different stamps to your P&IDs.

### Save and download workspace

To save your workspace, click **Save**. Click **Download** to download the P&IDs as a PDF. Note the previous point on **Layers** tool to adjust what is included in download. For instance if you have unchecked drawings, your download will not include drawings on the documents.
