# Roles in a CDF implementation

Implementing CDF projects can be large and complex and often requires the expertise and skills of many individuals. The list below shows the **roles** and **responsibilities** that we have found to be critical to making CDF a success. Individuals can have multiple responsibilities, and we split the roles across:

- Project team roles
- Supporting roles
- Other stakeholders

## Project team roles

- **Business owner** - Has intimate knowledge of the business problems to solve and understands what data is required to solve them. Helps define and design data-driven solutions.

- **CDF system administrator** - Sets up and manages CDF and data pipelines. Is responsible for access and data management.

- **Solution builder** - Builds data-driven solutions. Typically, these are data scientists, data analysts, developers, or subject matter experts.

## Supporting roles

- **Executive sponsor** - Champions the project and sets the business vision for the implementation. Articulates the value, communicates strategy and encourages adoption.

- **System integrator** - Sets up live connections between CDF and source systems during the implementation. Works closely with infrastructure engineers and source system administrators.

## Other stakeholders

- **Solution architect** - Uses technical expertise to integrate and optimize the use of CDF across the organization, tailoring solutions to meet developer and business needs

- **Infrastructure engineer** - Typically in charge of implementing, managing, and monitoring the organization's cloud and on-premises environments and solutions. Responsible for providing (if needed) on-prem infrastructure access and connectivity.

- **Security engineer** - Secures systems and protects data. Responsible for the design and implementation of digital security controls, managing access, and protecting your data in cloud networks and hybrid environments.

- **Source system administrator** - Grants access to source systems, helps understand their data models, and how to connect and extract data from them.

## Provide CDF training

Before you start implementing, ensure that the system administrator, the solution builders, and other organizational stakeholders receive training in CDF.

[Cognite Learn](https://learn.cognite.com) and [Cognite Docs](../../../cdf/index.md) have courses and technical product information to help you learn about the overall concepts and develop practical skills to support the implementation.

Contact your Cognite representative for further questions and access to additional learning content.
