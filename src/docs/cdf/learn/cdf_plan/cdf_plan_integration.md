# Identify data sources and plan your integration

What data you need to solve your business problems directly influences which **data sources** you choose to integrate with CDF **first**. To get started, we recommend that you focus on **well-defined data sets** for the asset/equipment in your scope and on the **essential** data to solve the business problem.

Often, it is helpful to start with data sets that have an **immediate integration option** available. Beginning with a relatively straight-forward ingestion pipeline can provide immediate project benefits. For example, you discover how the team best works together, and you can quickly showcase CDF's visualization capabilities to business and application users. **Visualization** is a potent tool for data exploration and often generates further excitement and interest in your CDF project.

It is common first to integrate one or more of these types of data:

- Asset hierarchy (or equipment hierarchy if applicable)
- Process data (time series)
- Work orders or alarms
- 3D/photogrammetry models of assets
- Documents associated with an asset

These questions can help you plan your integration:
