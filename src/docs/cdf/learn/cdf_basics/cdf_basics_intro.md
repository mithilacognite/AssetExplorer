# Introduction to Cognite Data Fusion (CDF)

Many organizations need to integrate and discover their **IT** (Information Technology) and **OT** (Operational Technology) data to explore and resolve operational issues.

**Cognite Data Fusion** (**CDF**) streams your data into the CDF data model where the data is normalized and enriched by adding connections between data resources of different types and stored in a graph index in the cloud. With your data in the cloud, you can use the CDF services and tools to build solutions and applications to **meet your business needs**.

With Cognite, **you** are the owner of your data. We use your data only to provide agreed-upon services. We handle your data **securely**, and we comply with **privacy** and **legal regulations**. If you leave our services, we make sure that you continue to have ownership of your data.

Organizations that are using Cognite Data Fusion benefit from:

- Significantly **reduced time** in data gathering and cleaning.
- **Decreased cost** of building, implementing, and scaling models.
- Auditable data that **increases trust**, helping experts cut time and costs.
