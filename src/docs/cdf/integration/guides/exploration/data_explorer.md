# Explore CDF resources

Use the CDF Data explorer to **find**, **validate**, and **learn** about the data you need to build solutions. Browse through all the available [resource types](../../../learn/cdf_basics/cdf_basics_datamodel.md) in your CDF project, then drill into details and related resources, for example, assets and time series with live data, interactive P&IDs, 3D, and mapped events.

You need these capabilities to use the Data Explorer:

- `resources:read`
- `events:read`
- `files:read`

## Get started

To open the Data explorer, navigate to [fusion.cognite.com](https://fusion.cognite.com) and select **Data explorer**. On the Data explorer page, all the resource types have a separate tab where you can search on any part of the name, description, or the external ID of a file or an asset.

- Click the **Filter** button to narrow down the search with filters relevant for the selected resource type.

- In the search result, select an element to see all its details and related resource types.
