| tool                       | Launch the [configuration tool](opc_ua_configuration.md) instead of the extractor. Use the configuration tool to analyze the server and suggest a suitable set of configuration options.                                                                                            |
| -e\|--endpoint-url [host]  | Override the **source.endpoint-url** config option and connects to the specified port instead. This generally has to be on the form `opc.tcp://…:port`.                                                                                                                             |

| -p\|--password [password]  | Override the Source/Password option and use the specified password connect to the OPC UA server.                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --secure                   | Allow to the extractor to attempt to connect to a secure endpoint if possible. This corresponds to the Source/Secure configuration option.                                                                                                                                          |
| -f\|--config-file [path]   | Override the location of the YAML configuration file. Can be a relative or absolute path.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| --auto-accept              | Auto-accept connections from unrecognized servers. You can set this the first time the extractor or the configuration tool connects to the server, and then remove it to ensure that the client only accepts connections from a server with the same certificate as the first time. |
| -d\|--config-dir [dir]     | Override the path to the configuration files. This is overwritten by the **config-file** option for YAML configuration files, but will still apply to the OPC UA XML configuration file. You can also set thos using the `OPCUA_CONFIG_DIR` environment variable.                   |
| -o\|--config-target [path] | Set the output path for the configuration tool. This should be a YAML file, and it will be overwritten. If this is the same as the configuration file, then (mostly) the results will be written back. We recommend that you use a different file.                                  |
| -n\|--no-config            | Don’t load any YAML configuration file. The OPC UA XML configuration file is still be needed, but as long as necessary information is provided using command-line options, the extractor or the config tool) can be run in a simple configuration without any configuration file.   |
| -l\|--log-level [level]    | Override the **logger**/**console**/**level** option. One of `verbose`, `debug`, `information`, `warning`, `error`.                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -w\|--working-dir [dir]    | Set the working directory of the extractor. Relative paths are relative to this value. Default is current directory for standalone, or one level above executable if starting as service.                                                                                           |
| -s\|--service              | Required when starting the extractor as a service. This option will not start the extractor as a service on its own, only make the necessary modifications when it is being called from the system.                                                                                 |
| -x\|--exit                 | Exit the extractor on failure. Overrides the Source/ExitOnFailure config option.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| --version                  | Show the current extractor version.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
