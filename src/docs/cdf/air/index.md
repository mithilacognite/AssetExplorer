# About AIR

:::info Note
**Cognite AIR** and **Cognite Functions** are not enabled by default. Contact [support@cognite.com](mailto:support@cognite.com) to enable them for your CDF project.
:::

Cognite **Automatic Identification and Reporting (AIR)** is a data science workflow that enables data scientists to build scalable models quickly and streamlines their interaction with their respective end-users.

AIR runs on top of **CDF** which collects and contextualizes data from a wide range of sources.

Data scientists develop code in GitHub that is deployed to Cognite Functions. AIR takes care of deployment, scheduling, notifications, feedback loop, and integration. Furthermore, AIR provides tools that speed up the model development process.

In short, you can use AIR to:

- Go from **calendar-based** monitoring to **event-based** monitoring
- **Empower subject matter experts** to configure and re-configure monitoring models
- **Enhance collaboration** between subject matter experts and model developers
- Enable **continuous improvement** of monitoring models
- Give model developers an **easy-to-use framework** to develop tailored models
- Integrate monitoring models from other system vendors
