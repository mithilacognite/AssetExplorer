# Use Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) as a data source in Excel

Before you can use CDF as a data source in Excel, an Azure Active Directory (AD) administrator need to [**register and consent**](admin.md) for your organization to use the Microsoft Power Query for Excel application and allow Excel to impersonate and act on behalf of a user to retrieve data from a CDF project.

When the Azure AD administrator has registered the Microsoft Power Query for Excel application, users can sign in to Excel with their organizational ID and [**retrieve data from a CDF project**](retrieve_data_from_cdf.md).
