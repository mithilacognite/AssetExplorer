# Get started

Grafana is open source visualization and analytics software. It allows you to query, visualize, alert on, and explore your **time series** data no matter where it is stored. With the **Cognite Data Source for Grafana** you can use a Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) project as a data source in Grafana.

**Getting started** with the Cognite Data Source is simple:

1. [**Connect the Cognite Data Source**](admin.md#connect-to-cognite-data-fusion-cdf) to your CDF project.

   If you already have an earlier version of the Cognite Data Source installed, make sure you upgrade it to the latest version.

1. [**Create a dashboard**](timeseries.md#create-a-dashboard) and select the time series you want to plot.

1. When you've learnt the basics, use [**custom queries**](timeseries.md#custom-queries) and advanced features like filtering, aggregation, granularity, arithmetic operations, and functions to work with your time series and visualizations.
