# About Cognite BestDay 



Cognite **BestDay** runs on top of Cognite Data Fusion (CDF) and is a **central hub** for decision support, providing a more **continuous, data-driven approach** to production optimization in your day-to-day operations. **Detect and assess deviations and underperformance** and act to **boost production and reduce production losses** by knowing your maximum achievable production and use it as a baseline for **visualizing inefficiencies**.

Cognite BestDay gives access to real-time and historical data, where different disciplines and shifts can have **one common collaboration platform** for decision making, knowing and understanding the production targets, be notified on abnormalities, log actions, as well as adding comments to the data and time ranges discussed.

## Maximum production capacity

To optimize production, you need to know your **maximum production capacity** to have an objective and comparable baseline-calculation across assets. The full calculation with criterias and constraints provides transparency to the operator and production engineer around their production targets.

The BestDay maximum production capacity is calculated for all hierarchy system levels using the sum of total hydrocarbon production and total hydrocarbon actual deferment. As input to the capacity calculation model, BestDay uses the daily production volume (and daily deferment volume) at all hierarchy system levels.

BestDay uses a statistical approach with configurable conditions and constraints and provides transparency into the calculations on different network levels from wells to topside processing facilities. Configurable data science models identify production deviations and search scheduled deferments to propose potential links or explanations.
