# About Cognite Asset Data Insight

Cognite **Asset Data Insight** is a dynamic application for operations and maintenance enabling powerful investigation, with one place to access, visualize, and examine industrial data.

Asset Data Insight runs on top of [Cognite Data Fusion (CDF)](../dev/index.md) which collects and contextualizes data from a wide range of sources.

With Asset Data Insight, users can immediately use this data to access and examine equipment history, sensor data, documents, and even specific use case dashboards, in one place, ensuring effective investigation.

To open Asset Data Insight, navigate to [https://insight.cogniteapp.com/](https://insight.cogniteapp.com/) and sign in with your company name and credentials.
