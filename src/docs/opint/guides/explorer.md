# Explore and investigate

When you investigate a piece of equipment or a system, you usually need access to many different types of data.

Traditionally, users view **equipment details** in one system, **documents** in another system, **sensor values** in another system, and **maintenance history** in yet another system.

Asset Data Insight speeds up these workflows and lets you view all this data **in one place**.

## Search for assets, documents, and time series

Select **Search** in the navigation menu to open up global search, where you can search for any assets, documents, and time series in CDF.

## Find specific assets or systems

Select **Data Explorer** in the navigation menu to navigate the asset hierarchy or search for assets.

When you're searching, you can click the filter icon to filter your results by asset description or metadata.

## Examine relevant data

Once you have selected an asset, you can examine documents, sensor values, maintenance history, a mini 3D model, and more for that asset.

## Filter on relevant data

Once you are on an asset page, you can filter on that data to view what is most important to you.

<!---## Navigate by 3D model

From the 3D page on an asset, you can navigate to other assets of interest. Note: Only assets with a linked 3D model will have a 3D page.

## Navigate by clickable P&IDs

You can access clickable P&IDs from the **Documents** page of an asset. The P&IDs highlight the asset that you are currently on, and let you navigate to other assets of interest.

## Create quick access links

You can star assets and asset boards for quick access.

From the home page or from the data explorer, you can also see your recently visited assets.
