Currently, we recommend that you run Asset Data Insight in Google Chrome.

### Where does the underlying data displayed in the application come from?

The asset information, sensor data, documents, event history, and 3D models are pulled from Cognite Data Fusion, which cleans and contextualizes data from many different source systems.

If you are missing data in this application, see time series with the wrong names, or documents linked to the wrong assets, it means that the data is missing or incorrectly represented in Cognite Data Fusion.

To troubleshoot this, we recommend that you contact the people in your organization responsible for the quality of data in Cognite Data Fusion.

The different dashboards, charts, infographics, etc. are generated by users.
