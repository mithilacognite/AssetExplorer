# Embed external dashboards

## Grafana

To embed external dashboards from Grafana, you need to set [cookie-samesite](https://grafana.com/docs/installation/configuration/#cookie-samesite) to `none` in your organization's Grafana settings.
Please contact your organization's IT support to request this change.

## Power BI

- To retrieve the embed URL, select **File** > **Embed**.
- To share the report with other members of your organization, ensure that you have given them view permission from the **Share** menu.
  View permissions are set in the Power BI service.

For more information, see [How to embed a Power BI report in a secure portal or website](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/service-embed-secure).
