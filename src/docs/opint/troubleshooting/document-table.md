# Document table

Asset Data Insight displays all documentation associated with an item in the asset hierarchy.
To make it easier to navigate the documents, Asset Data Insight automatically groups them into categories.

<img src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/opint/asset-document-table.png" alt=" " width="80%"/>

The sections below describe how Asset Data Insight determines the categorization and the document names to display.
If you need help changing the grouping, contact [support@cognite.com](mailto:support@cognite.com).

## Categories

This is how Asset Data Insight groups the documents into categories:

1. First, check for a `doc_type` metadata field.

   If the field exists and the field value is specified in accordance with the Document Type Codes in the [NORSOK Z-DP-002] standard, Asset Data Insight uses the value as the document's type category.

2. Next, attempt to parse the filename by the [NORSOK Z-DP-002] standard.

   If Asset Data Insight can parse the filename, it extracts the document category from the filename.

3. Otherwise, the category is unknown.

### Category titles

This is how Asset Data Insight determines the titles of the categories:

1. Check if the value is specified by the Document Type Codes in the [NORSOK Z-DP-002] standard.

   - If the value is specified in the [NORSOK Z-DP-002] standard, map to the specified value. For example, `doc_type: XB` is categorized as "P&ID".
   - Otherwise, Asset Data Insight uses the value as the category title. For example, `doc_type: Sketch` is categorized as "Sketch".

### Category order

Asset Data Insight displays the categories in alphabetic order.

## Document name

This is how Asset Data Insight determines the document name to display:

1. First, check for a `doc_title` metadata field.

   If the field exists, use the value as the document name.

2. Next, check for a `title` metadata field.

   If the field exists, use the value as the document name.

3. Otherwise, use the filename as the document name.
