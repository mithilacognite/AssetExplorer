# Document previews

When you're using the file browser in Asset Data Insight, you may see a message like this to notify you that you can not preview the current file:

<img className="screenshot" src="https://apps-cdn.cogniteapp.com/@cognite/docs-portal-images/1.0.0/images/opint/20200318_cannotPreview.png" alt=" " width="80%"/>

You can only preview certain types of files inside Asset Data Insight.
To preview other types of files, click the download link and then open the file locally.

## Supported documents
